# WPI CS 4732 Project 0: Hello, Animated Cube!

by [Daniel Beckwith](https://github.com/dbeckwith)

## Installation

First, make sure Python 3.5 is installed. Then, use `pip` to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) and [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/) packages. If you're on Windows and `pip` can't install the packages, you may have to download the appropriate wheel files from [here](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install path/to/wheel1 path/to/wheel2
```

## Usage

From the project root, run the python module with the help option to see its usage:

```bash
python -m proj0 --help
```
